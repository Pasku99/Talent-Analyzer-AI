2021-12-12,toddwilliamnelson,Todd Nelson,"Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada",CA,,,,Student at University of Saskatchewan,66.0,"I am a recent graduate of the University of Saskatchewan's bachelors of science program, majoring in biochemistry and biotechnology. From a young age I have always been fascinated with the natural world. Why does life exist? What processes govern the formation and behavior of individual organisms and how can those processes be exploited or modified in a beneficial manner? To this end, I have completed a fair number of biomedical science courses at my university and am seeking an opportunity to apply my knowledge of the various aspects of metabolism, DNA synthesis and repair, and protein structure/function to foster a greater understanding of the world we live in, as well as make it better where I can.","[{""attribution"":""Liked by Todd Nelson"",""img"":""https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQGD-PJnXZmU8g/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0/1629053584973?e=1645056000&v=beta&t=eZ4bCVKLVgRJq8wlpF7KzVXZG978oNsmxp3sI28omrY"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6734268521339076608"",""title"":""Congratulations, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
