Asimismo soy Licenciada en Psicología por la UCACIS y terapeuta en consultorio privado. A nivel pedagógico, la experiencia como profesora tutora y mis estudios en psicología me han brindado importantes habilidades para el acompañamiento, seguimiento y desarrollo de los alumnos. En el aula, estos conocimientos me han permitido desarrollar una amplia y ecléctica metodología de enseñanza, incorporando ideas y propuestas de distintos ámbitos, que favorece la concentración y el aprendizaje de nuestros alumnos, acostumbrados a múltiples y constantes estímulos por los medios de comunicación que los rodean. En investigación, he participado de variados congresos y coloquios de la mano de Alalite, y he colaborado con la edición y producción de libros.

2023-01-13,jonahmolina,Jonah Molina,"Wailuku, Hawaii, United States",US,,,Infrared Inspections Hawaii,Certified Level 2 Thermographer & President of Infrared Inspections Hawaii,,"Originally starting out in the I.T. field, I discovered that the formal studies required to pursue a college education in I.T didn't appeal to me, so I change to Humanities. Through various courses and the socializing that it entailed I developed a particularly good skill in people-to-people interaction. Utilizing this skill, I found my way into the customer/clientele service industry; restaurants, tour guiding, student advisor, various computer and network-based work, mechanic, electrician, legislative aide, landscaping, and English instructing. By using my skills in handling people/customers/clients I was able to learn a wide array of abilities from these past job experiences. From living and teaching English in Japan to jumping into the electrical trade, I found an avenue to combine both my love for IT, investigation, and critical thinking skills I learned through my electrical apprenticeship. In 2020 I founded and began building CIRI Hawaii LLC, CIRI standing for Commerical Infrared Inspections. We provide electrical, mechanical, roof, building envelope, and energy audit infrared surveys for commercial facilities small and large. Not only is it our mission to serve all of Hawaii's facilities, but also to facilitate relationships with all those we come into contact with. Business is about relationships and being in Hawaii makes that statement more so. We are a Hawaii-born, raised, founded, and operated business and bring that aloha every day.","[{""attribution"":""Liked by Jonah Molina"",""img"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQEPD72_XVHzPA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1673381283261?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=rg5UY0FRbH2EbU26AQuMWX4b95NEBAeBiRtCsI-dXzI"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/patricia-stricker-57343464_for-those-packing-their-bags-for-irinfo-activity-7018669815091388416-8BPW"",""title"":""For those packing their bags for IR/INFO this weekend.... don't forget your challenge coins....

A sustainable change is what I quest for in all endeavour and I do so by quickly learning and talking into the worldview of my hearers. I served as a social worker for two years in Volta north(krachi-Abujuro to be specific) under the Third Trimester Field Program of the University of Development Studies Ghana. I have also just worked as a missionary for two years in fostering a new church and it's community for the Seventh Day Adventist Church of Ghana in Bole-Mandare. I participated in developing and administering questionnaire to build effective structures for nursery operation in Cocobod-Ched Ghana in Berekum. Within a period of 10 months I work as an extensionist in 15 communities to change the feeling of indifference by farmers toward Ched Berekum through regular farm visit, intensified farm measurement, rigorous group formation and strengthening, timely farm inspection, phone call extension services, efficient and equitable distribution of chemical inputs and fertilizer to farmers and strengthening social tides with farmers. In the forest investment program (FIP) in Ghana I served as a cordinator in organizing rallies and training for cocoa farmers.","[{""attribution"":""Shared by Benjamin Ashaley Amuah"",""img"":""https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQGYpJk0hdgcoA/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1634358817535?e=1645660800&v=beta&t=yZlF5fgU3FhrRNtKzNReQe-mKFhR89dEeVRYsXvHfQQ"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6854997729752477696"",""title"":""Photo""},{""attribution"":""Shared by Benjamin Ashaley Amuah"",""img"":""https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQFQbWtxEg6RSw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1632423496250?e=1645660800&v=beta&t=taHX63bkOb2Y9ZqMv_xFbQvJlKj8YPYqYAtuSUZTEL8"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6846880424870903808"",""title"":""Photo""},{""attribution"":""Liked by Benjamin Ashaley Amuah"",""img"":""https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/C5627AQEMqDMEC5eMTg/articleshare-shrink_800/0/1642263609684?e=1642892400&v=beta&t=Bv6YYefRBS43v_5cw_kYSoGhesDy2W7h_CRtbWlXBy8"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6816643101382234112"",""title"":""If progress is going to be made on better socio-ecological urbanism in African cities, then the children-informal green space connections need to be…""}]","[{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Asunkpa Bee Farms""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""AGRO Agricultura Eficiente Rentable y Competitiva""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Agro Commodity,Fresh Produce & Food Products-FPO,Mfr,Buyer,Importer & Exporter- # 1 World Group""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""AGRICULTURE LEGENDS""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Agromanagement""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Agro Business Park A/S""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Jobs in Ghana""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Reality Innovators Network (RIN) for Metaverse, VR, AR & XR (Virtual, Augmented & Extended Reality)""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Agronomists""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""Public Relations Specialists""},{""img"":null,""subtitle"":""-"",""title"":""The IIAR> (Institute of Influencer and Analyst Relations)""}]","{""link"":null,""name"":""Ghana Cocobod CHED""}","[{""company"":""Ghana Cocobod CHED"",""company_id"":null,""location"":""Berekum,Ghana"",""positions"":[{""description"":""Primarily working as a cocoa extension officer Primarily working as a cocoa extension officer"",""duration"":""Jan 2016 -

When I went into the sessions I had a personal topic that occupied me but I had only a rough idea of what I wanted to get out of the sessions. Thanks to Sandra’s ability to be fully present and create a safe and supportive environment, to focus completely on what I said hearing also the underlying meaning and reflect it back to me, her genuine interest in my themes and her flexibility to deal with whatever I came up with and ask powerful questions that made me think, I was able to gain much clarity around the topic that had occupied me so much. Excessively so I was even able to complete several major activities that helped me to free myself from limiting beliefs and unfold my potential. Sandra was always well prepared for our sessions and gave me the space I needed to “sort my thoughts”. She frequently acknowledged my endeavors and progresses and I enjoyed the sessions with her very much. I can wholeheartedly recommend her as a coach. Silvia Richter-Kaupp”,Pamela Rudisill, CPC, GCC “Sandra is a truly gifted coach! Her kind and compassion nature instills trust, allowing for the freedom to explore your ideas and beliefs. She will listen with great care and help you gain the insight and perspective necessary to create lasting change. I highly recommend Sandra if you are looking for an effective professional coach to help you reach your goals and live your best life!”",6.0,,,0,4,5,2,0,0,14,1

Morten here, I am an outgoing, energetic and creative soul who has years of experience behind me in various industries. Regardless of the industry, I have always had my MOTTO top of mind: You get what you give! The motto has given me a lot of joy, at work as well as privately. If we all start our communication at zero, with the text: ""You're ok, I'm ok"", whether we are Directors or Laundry Helpers - we get synergies that are absolutely essential for joint happiness and success. For approx. a year ago I discovered AI - Digital art, and I have been hooked on this field ever since. Got good press coverage and now have a contract with an agent company in Paris, France.

Både lærerikt og inspirerende å sitte ned og høre på dine idéer og forslag, du har helt klart dratt min karriere i riktig retning. Man merker raskt at han har bred kompetanse og kontroll i arbeidet han driver med. En mer kreativ, løsningsorientert og business-minded kollega enn deg kan man lete langt etter. Skulle du trenge noe av reklameprodukter så ordner Morten ALT. Dersom jeg får muligheten til å jobbe med Morten i fremtiden er jeg heldig!

Han sitter på en unik spisskompetanse, og jeg må bare ta av meg hatten for den farten han får jobben gjort og levert på.

En faglig, dyktig og voksen mann, som mitt selskap med alle ansatte, har hatt mye med å gjøre,. og alle er enige i at Klemetsen er en sjelden fin fyr og ikke minst lett og prate med og han lytter til kundene og finner fort ut hva de vil ha og/eller trenger. Mannen er lett å gjøre seg forstått overfor.

Jeg har vært direktør og leder for over 43 ansatte og innleide, alle håndplukket av meg selv da jeg alltid speider talentene til min bedrift selv. Klemetsen er en mann jeg hadde uten tvil valgt og sporenstreks, ville ha ansatt på dagen! Dessverre har vi ikke noen ledig stilling til en mann som han her. Klemetsen er ikke bare profesjonelt faglig dyktig på sine ting, han er en stor inspirasjonskilde, gledesspreder og en formidabel ressursperson som kan bidra med imponerende mye på mange forskjellige områder.

He was exceptionally good at his job, particularly figuring out complex business data flows. He quickly understands a business need, figures out the best technical solution, and can build practically anything that is easy for business users to use and seamlessly integrates with existing databases and analytics. He also excels at quantitative and analytical challenges and opportunities. He owned our Tableau business intelligence initiative and built out our first Tableau analytics. Additionally, he quickly became my right hand even though I had three others on the team. I did most of my brainstorming with him, and relied on him for his creativity, exceptional problem-solving skills, good judgment, honesty, and calm demeanor. It was a hectic and demanding job with changing priorities and many emergencies. Dan kept me and the whole team calm and focused on what we needed to do. He has a quiet and powerful leadership style that everyone respected, including other teams and contractors. I will always consider Dan a friend and technical/professional consultant.”",1.0,,,0,1,2,0,0,0,32,1

Miałam przyjemność pracować z Piotrem przez około rok nad rozwojem mojej kariery zawodowej i działalności biznesowej. Piotr wykazał się dużą elastycznością, empatią i ""ludzkim podejściem"" i krok po kroku pomógł mi wyjść z impasu i rozwinąć się według najoptymistyczniejszych scenariuszy. Piotr pozostając otwartym na moje własne cele, potrafił równocześnie skutecznie egzekwować ich realizację. Współpraca z Piotrem przynosi pozytywne i długofalowe efekty. ”,Catarzyna Janusz “Z niecierpliwością każdorazowo czekam na spotkania z Piotrem. Po odbytej sesji jestem zmotywowana do pracy nad sobą i chciałabym więcej od zaraz. Piotr zwrócił mi uwagę na rzeczy, których wcześniej nie widziałam. Nie zauważałam. Trudne do uwierzenia, ale to niesamowite ile może dać konstruktywna rozmowa. Odkryłam wiele zaskakujących rzeczy o sobie, zespole. Zrozumiałam skąd biorą się przeszkody i jak znaleźć klucz do ich rozwiązania. I co najważniejsze – powoli i skutecznie osiągam swój zamierzony cel. Współpraca z Piotrem to przyjemność. Polecam każdemu kto poszukuje pomysłu na siebie, właściwej drogi. Dziękuję Piotr.”",4.0,,,0,6,5,2,0,0,0,1
