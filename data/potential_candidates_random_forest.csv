Previous to Charter Spectrum, I worked briefly in the insurance industry, where our goal was – in addition to new business development, client retention and expansion. My value to an organization, based on my experience, will be my ability to identify and develop leads, and utilize value-marketing to engage the customer and ultimately close sales.

2023-01-13,jonahmolina,Jonah Molina,"Wailuku, Hawaii, United States",US,,,Infrared Inspections Hawaii,Certified Level 2 Thermographer & President of Infrared Inspections Hawaii,,"Originally starting out in the I.T. field, I discovered that the formal studies required to pursue a college education in I.T didn't appeal to me, so I change to Humanities. Through various courses and the socializing that it entailed I developed a particularly good skill in people-to-people interaction. Utilizing this skill, I found my way into the customer/clientele service industry; restaurants, tour guiding, student advisor, various computer and network-based work, mechanic, electrician, legislative aide, landscaping, and English instructing. By using my skills in handling people/customers/clients I was able to learn a wide array of abilities from these past job experiences. From living and teaching English in Japan to jumping into the electrical trade, I found an avenue to combine both my love for IT, investigation, and critical thinking skills I learned through my electrical apprenticeship. In 2020 I founded and began building CIRI Hawaii LLC, CIRI standing for Commerical Infrared Inspections. We provide electrical, mechanical, roof, building envelope, and energy audit infrared surveys for commercial facilities small and large. Not only is it our mission to serve all of Hawaii's facilities, but also to facilitate relationships with all those we come into contact with. Business is about relationships and being in Hawaii makes that statement more so. We are a Hawaii-born, raised, founded, and operated business and bring that aloha every day.","[{""attribution"":""Liked by Jonah Molina"",""img"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQEPD72_XVHzPA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1673381283261?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=rg5UY0FRbH2EbU26AQuMWX4b95NEBAeBiRtCsI-dXzI"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/patricia-stricker-57343464_for-those-packing-their-bags-for-irinfo-activity-7018669815091388416-8BPW"",""title"":""For those packing their bags for IR/INFO this weekend.... don't forget your challenge coins....

When I went into the sessions I had a personal topic that occupied me but I had only a rough idea of what I wanted to get out of the sessions. Thanks to Sandra’s ability to be fully present and create a safe and supportive environment, to focus completely on what I said hearing also the underlying meaning and reflect it back to me, her genuine interest in my themes and her flexibility to deal with whatever I came up with and ask powerful questions that made me think, I was able to gain much clarity around the topic that had occupied me so much. Excessively so I was even able to complete several major activities that helped me to free myself from limiting beliefs and unfold my potential. Sandra was always well prepared for our sessions and gave me the space I needed to “sort my thoughts”. She frequently acknowledged my endeavors and progresses and I enjoyed the sessions with her very much. I can wholeheartedly recommend her as a coach.

Morten here, I am an outgoing, energetic and creative soul who has years of experience behind me in various industries. Regardless of the industry, I have always had my MOTTO top of mind: You get what you give! The motto has given me a lot of joy, at work as well as privately. If we all start our communication at zero, with the text: ""You're ok, I'm ok"", whether we are Directors or Laundry Helpers - we get synergies that are absolutely essential for joint happiness and success. For approx. a year ago I discovered AI - Digital art, and I have been hooked on this field ever since. Got good press coverage and now have a contract with an agent company in Paris, France. Is there anything I can help with? Send an inmail or txt me. Have a wonderful day ahead, and remember to live 100%!

WHO I WORK WITH: I work with key people in organizations, entrepreneurs and other coaches. WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING: The comments I hear most of the time: “ I didn’t realize that so much was possible to achieve over such a short period of time” “ You asked me some questions I hated, but I did need to answer.” “You helped me get the focus and structure I needed” MY BACKGROUND: I am a successful entrepreneur, business coach and mentor. Since 2010 I have supported over one thousand two hundred business leaders and owners as well as other coaches as coach mentor and workshop facilitator.","[{""attribution"":""By Piotr Jankiewicz"",""created_at"":""2018-11-26T00:00:00.000Z"",""img"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQGtVp_0bkgVaA/article-cover_image-shrink_180_320/0/1543239514396?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=4kkTwh7Q6Sf2GT_vu4beE83MliTW67xrlqeooKCoyWM"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ci%C4%85g-dalszy-o-tym-co-wp%C5%82ywa-na-zwrot-inwestycji-w-piotr-jankiewicz?trk=public_profile_article_view"",""title"":""Ciąg dalszy o tym, co wpływa na zwrot inwestycji w szkolenia językowe w firmie""},{""attribution"":""By Piotr Jankiewicz"",""created_at"":""2018-11-19T00:00:00.000Z"",""img"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQHoc2hQcytCzQ/article-cover_image-shrink_180_320/0/1542622737002?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=asyOiP3_E0aIXVmEMgeICWH4lHVvfzhgQkGUtuALeag"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/co-decyduje-o-sukcesie-szkole%C5%84-j%C4%99zykowych-w-firmie-piotr-jankiewicz?trk=public_profile_article_view"",""title"":""Co decyduje o sukcesie szkoleń językowych w firmie?""},{""attribution"":""By Piotr Jankiewicz"",""created_at"":""2018-10-24T00:00:00.000Z"",""img"":""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQHrgVruCB2ieA/article-cover_image-shrink_180_320/0/1540368575195?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=BmlK1XPBIi_g6GveNj9zhFOyhItniKxsx9Cy7aL_YQ8"",""link"":""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/looking-teacher-russian-vilnius-piotr-jankiewicz?trk=public_profile_article_view"",""title"":""Looking for a Teacher of Russian in VILNIUS!""}]",,"{""name"":""Piotr Jankiewicz Coach for MORE""}","[{""description"":""Are you a coach, language teacher, fitness instructor, business trainer, health professional?

Miałam przyjemność pracować z Piotrem przez około rok nad rozwojem mojej kariery zawodowej i działalności biznesowej. Piotr wykazał się dużą elastycznością, empatią i ""ludzkim podejściem"" i krok po kroku pomógł mi wyjść z impasu i rozwinąć się według najoptymistyczniejszych scenariuszy. Piotr pozostając otwartym na moje własne cele, potrafił równocześnie skutecznie egzekwować ich realizację. Współpraca z Piotrem przynosi pozytywne i długofalowe efekty. ”,Catarzyna Janusz “Z niecierpliwością każdorazowo czekam na spotkania z Piotrem. Po odbytej sesji jestem zmotywowana do pracy nad sobą i chciałabym więcej od zaraz. Piotr zwrócił mi uwagę na rzeczy, których wcześniej nie widziałam. Nie zauważałam. Trudne do uwierzenia, ale to niesamowite ile może dać konstruktywna rozmowa. Odkryłam wiele zaskakujących rzeczy o sobie, zespole. Zrozumiałam skąd biorą się przeszkody i jak znaleźć klucz do ich rozwiązania. I co najważniejsze – powoli i skutecznie osiągam swój zamierzony cel. Współpraca z Piotrem to przyjemność. Polecam każdemu kto poszukuje pomysłu na siebie, właściwej drogi. Dziękuję Piotr.”",4.0,,,0,6,5,2,0,0,0,1
